# Data Engineering Take-Home: Live Assistant Analytics

Welcome! This repo gives you a running, **continuously-growing** operational
database for a conversational-AI product. Your job is to ingest it
into an analytical warehouse and build analytics on top. The warehouse side is
**not** included, that's what you'll build!

---

## What's provided

A single `docker compose up` starts three things:

1. **`postgres`**: the operational database. It has a wal replication on.
2. **`seed`**: a one-shot container that creates the schema and bulk-loads a
   realistic dataset (~1k users, ~50 assistants, ~5k conversations, ~100k
   messages, plus feedback), then exits. It's idempotent and re-runnable.
3. **`streamer`**: a long-running container that **inserts 1-10 new messages
   into existing conversations every 2 seconds**, simulating live production
   traffic. This is what keeps the database growing while you work.

Data is stored in a named Docker volume (`pgdata`) and persists across restarts
until you reset it.

---

## How to start it

```bash
docker compose up --build
# or, in the background:
make up
```

Within about a minute you'll have a populated database that keeps growing. You
should see the streamer logging inserts:

```
[streamer] inserted 7 messages (prompt, answer, tool:web_search, ...), total this run: 42
```

## Schema overview

Seven tables. UUID primary keys, `timestamptz` everywhere, real foreign keys,
and indexes on the hot paths (`messages(created_at)`, `messages(conversation_id)`,
`messages(type)`). Full DDL is in [`schema.sql`](./schema.sql).

| Table           | Purpose                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `users`         | End users, email, name, department, country, locale, `plan` (free/pro/enterprise)                                                             |
| `models`        | Reference table of models + token pricing (`input/output_cost_per_1k`)                                                                        |
| `assistants`    | Configurable AI agents (name, description, system prompt, `created_by`)                                                                       |
| `conversations` | A thread for a user, optionally tied to an assistant; `source` (web/api/slack/teams)                                                          |
| `messages`      | The fact table, every prompt, answer, reasoning step, tool call                                                                               |
| `feedback`      | Thumbs up/down (`rating` = 1 / -1) on assistant messages, optional comment                                                                    |
| `usage`         | Token usage per generation, `user_id`, `model_id`, `uncached_input_tokens`, `cached_input_tokens`, `output_tokens` (join `models` for $ cost) |

Every `messages` row has a non-null `user_id` (the conversation's user) and
`model_id` (the conversation's model), so you can attribute any message to a
user and model directly.

## Your task

**Continuously ingest this live Postgres into an analytical warehouse of your
choice** (ClickHouse, Databricks, Snowflake, Postgres-as-warehouse, …),

The goal is also not just to have the analytical setup but to go down the modelling part as well. Think about what are the interesting dashboards the use cases needs.

---

## Deliverables

1. **Code**: your ingestion + warehouse + analytics, runnable with clear
   instructions (ideally `docker compose` or a short script) as git repo or zip.
2. **A short writeup** (~1 page): how it works, why
   you chose the architecture, how would you address scaling needs, how freshness is maintained, what you'd do with more
   time, and any assumptions.

---

## Evaluation criteria

Try to invest no more than 6 hours on the challenge. After the challenge please send your submission (fork or zip) in an email to omar.eladawy@langdock.com with karl@langdock.com in CC.

Treat this as not only a platform challenge but a modelling one. What models did you decide for and why, how would you prepare for scaling needs etc. We care more about **clear thinking and sound trade-offs** than about covering every nice-to-have.

Good luck, have fun with it!
